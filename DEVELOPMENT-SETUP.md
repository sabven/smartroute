This guide helps you quickly set up a complete development environment for SmartRoute with sample data.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL database running
- Node.js installed
- Dependencies installed (`npm install` in both server and client directories)

NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8000
```

### 3. Database Setup with Sample Data
